# Life Utils API ü§Ø

*Because adulting is hard and APIs should be honest about it*

## What is this?

## API Endpoints

All endpoints embrace the sleep and include loading messages like:

- "API went dormant like your succulent..."
- "Currently procrastinating on your procrastination..."

## The Sleep Experience

This API runs on Render's free tier, which means it sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity. Instead of fighting this limitation, we've made it part of the brand:

- 30+ second cold starts with entertaining loading messages
- Different sleep messages for each API endpoint
- Status page: "All systems sleeping peacefully"
- Health check returns: `{"status": "probably fine", "energy_level": "meh"}`

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (minimal and lightweight)
- **Database**: None (we believe in living dangerously)
- **Hosting**: Render Free Tier (sleeping beautifully)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (because we're keeping it simple)

## Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/L-RexTech/life-utils-api.git
cd life-utils-api
npm install
npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the API in action.

## Deployment to Render

1. Connect your GitHub repo to Render
2. Create a new Web Service
3. Use these settings:
   - **Build Command**: `npm install`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`
   - **Plan**: Free (obviously)
4. Deploy and wait for it to sleep

## Contributing

Found a bug? That's not a bug, that's a feature reflecting the chaos of modern life.

Want to add a new API? Make sure it:
- Solves a real but ridiculous problem
- Has appropriately sarcastic error messages
- Embraces the absurdity of existence
- Works well with the sleep experience

## License

MIT - Use it, abuse it, let it sleep peacefully.

## Disclaimer

This API may not actually solve your life problems, but it will make you laugh about them. Response times are "whenever we feel like it" and that's part of the charm.
